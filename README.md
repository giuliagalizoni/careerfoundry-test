Hello ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the code challenge for the Junior Frontend Developer position.

#

## Notes

- This project was built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). I also used [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) to manage API requests and [Date.fns](https://date-fns.org/) to format dates.
- As suggested, to get the user's location, I used Ipstack, which requires an access key. To test it, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and assign a key to the environment variable `REACT_APP_IPSTACK_KEY`. Please let me know if this is a problem -- I would be happy to share my key.

## Points I would improve if I had more time

- Delay when buttons are clicked -- there is a small discomfort when the buttons are clicked due to the state being cleared before the API call. I would think of a better way to avoid the delay between API calls.
- Errors management -- If anything goes wrong with the API requests, it is important to show the user an error page.
- Styles -- CSS files could be better architectured to avoid code repetition.
- Layout -- there is much room for improvement on the page's looks (though I might need a designer for that).
